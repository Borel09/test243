/**
 * DATATYPES: Understanding the different value types used in JavaScript is important because it allows us to
 *be able to manipulate values and data within a program. JavaScript uses six main data types and 
 *can be seperated into three different categories: Primitive and Complex. Primitive data types refer
 *to the fact that variables have a fixed amount of memory, however, complex data types do not have 
 *a fixed size. Therefore, primitive datatypes store data by copying values and complex data types
 *store data through copying by reference.
 *
 *There are three primitive data types: strings, numbers, and bolean values.
